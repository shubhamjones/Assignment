Q9 - Differnce between Selenium RC and Selenium WebDriver.

Ans- Selenium WebDriver drives the browser using browser's built-in support while 
     Selenium RC injects javascript function into browsers when the web page is loaded.

     As selenium RC is injecting java script code to browsers , the browsers act almost in         similar  manner But for WebDriver the calls are made directly using particular browser's native support ,the browsers behave more like in case of user interactions

     Web Driver's API is more concise than Selenium RC's.

     Web Driver can support Html Unit while Selenium RC cannot.
