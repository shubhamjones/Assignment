Q8. Difference between get() & navigate() method

Ans- driver.get() method will just get you the webpage and will wait until the webpage is      loaded but driver.
navigate() method allows us to move forward or backward in the browser. 
if we want to go to the previous page we use driver.navigate().back() and after getting on previous page if we want to go to the next page we use driver.navigate.forward().
