The main advantage of testNG can be listed as follows:-


1.TestNG provides parallel execution of test methods
2.It allows to define dependency of one test method over other method
3.It allows to assign priority to test methods
4.It allows grouping of test methods into test groups
5.It has support for parameterizing test cases using @Parameters annotation
6.It allows data driven testing using @DataProvider annotation
7.It has different assertions that helps in checking the expected and actual results
8.Detailed (HTML) reports

Advantages of TestNG annotations:-

1.With the help of annotations, multiple test can be run at the same time.
2.Annotations provide manipulation in order of running tests.
3.Annotations provide parameterization in Tests.
4.Annotations helps in performing special methods on different scenarios of tests,if any
  test fails we can give some conditions to it.. if any one passes we can provide some other
  conditions.
